### Overview
The project focuses on building a user interface that will allow others to browse a webpage on UFO sighting data using filters


### Results

The user would navigate to the homescreen to find the options to select dates, city, country and shape. The user would then be able to read comments that describe the sightings


### Summary

Drawbacks to this design and layout are that the user would have to know what city or date to look for to read the comments. This would be difficult as there are no drop down arrows to help narrow down the options, which would be a positive add on to the layout
